Dive into the world of 'Orb Odyssey,' a Unity-based game created by me. Using the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys, control your orb as it traverses a stone bench. Navigate forward and backward, while rotating your view with 'A' and 'D'.
Beware of other orbs vying to dislodge you! Stay sharp and collect power-ups to gain an edge and repel competitors.
Challenge yourself and see how far you can go. Share your progress and enjoy the journey with 'Orb Odyssey'!
You can now play it on Play.Unity by clicking the link below:
